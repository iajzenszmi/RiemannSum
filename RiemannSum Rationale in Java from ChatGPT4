Here is a simple Java program that demonstrates the concept of a Riemann sum, which is a method for approximating the area under a curve. This example approximates the area under the curve of f(x) = x^2 on the interval [0, 1] using a Riemann sum:

java

public class RiemannSumExample {

    // Function to integrate
    public static double f(double x) {
        return x * x; // Example function: f(x) = x^2
    }

    // Method to approximate the area under the curve using a Riemann sum
    public static double riemannSum(int intervals) {
        double area = 0.0;
        double delta = 1.0 / intervals; // Width of each interval
        for (int i = 0; i < intervals; i++) {
            double x = i * delta;
            area += f(x) * delta; // Height * width for each rectangle
        }
        return area;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int intervals = 1000; // Number of intervals to use
        double approximateArea = riemannSum(intervals);
        System.out.println("Approximate area under the curve: " + approximateArea);
    }
}

In this program:

    f(x) is the function we want to integrate. Here, it's defined as f(x) = x^2.
    riemannSum(intervals) is the method that computes the Riemann sum approximation for the area under f(x) between 0 and 1. It divides the interval into smaller sub-intervals (specified by intervals) and sums up the area of rectangles under the curve, with each rectangle's height determined by the function's value at the left endpoint of the sub-interval.
    main method sets the number of intervals to 1000 and prints out the approximate area calculated by the Riemann sum method.

You can run this Java program to see the approximate area under f(x) = x^2 from 0 to 1. Adjusting the number of intervals will change the accuracy of the approximation.
